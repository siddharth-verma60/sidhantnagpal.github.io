The community bonding period has concluded. As proposed, I have gone through the existing modules and have thought about various aspects of the implementation which needed to be taken care of. I have reached out to my mentors and the discussion will take place on `gitter` under `sympy/discrete`.

Discussion for API is premature but it will shape as the Coding Period commences. Meanwhile, I have control of what all needs to be done in accordance with the proposed timeline.

Having contributed previously to SymPy, I am familiar with the workflow and methodologies. So, during this period I helped new contributors get started and also helped review existing PRs - [#14678](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14679), [#14698](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14698) and [#14707](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14707).

Looking forward to Coding Period.
