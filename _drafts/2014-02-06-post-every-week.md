Starting from today, I will be blogging **at least** once a week!  
I wanted to follow this since the day I started blogging, but it never came to implementation.

Up until now, I blogged when I had nothing else to do. That ought to change.  

To quote Matt Might from his blog post on
[How to blog as an academic](http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-blog-as-an-academic/):  

_"The secret to low-cost academic blogging is to make blogging a natural byproduct of all the things that academics already do."_

* Answering the same question a second time? Put it in a blog post.
* Writing a detailed email reply? _Reply to public_ with a blog post.
* Writing interesting code? Comment a snippet into a post.
* Doing something geeky at home? Blog about what you learned.

--UPDATE--  
I always fail to implement this. I have failed again. Let's try this another time ;)
