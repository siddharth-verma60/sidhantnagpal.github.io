The state of privacy on the Internet is spine-tingling scary. I will not repeat the effort of
blabbing about [how you are being spied upon](https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying) and 
[tracked](http://donttrack.us/) on almost every corner of the web. I would rather prefer to tell
the tale of how I am trying to save my arse.

[Prism-Break](http://prism-break.org) was extremely helpful, in providing me alternatives.

I deleted my facebook account (which had >500 friends), and created a new one with around 30
friends, whom I actually need to talk to. Some weeks ago, I deactivated this account too.
I have (almost) stopped using Google for searching the Web, and use [DuckDuckGo](http://ddg.gg)
instead. For personal emails I now use [Riseup](http://riseup.net), and GPG encryption.
I use FirefoxOS on my smartphone, and download only those apps from the Marketplace which
have their code open for public review. I switched to [Diaspora](http://diasporafoundation.org/) -
an alternative social network. But maybe I lack the courage to delete my Google+ account.

I was using *StatCounter* for this blog to keep a track of visitors and *Disqus* for 
comments. Until I fired up [Lightbeam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightbeam_%28software%29)
and saw how almost every website I visit uses Google Analytics. This means that Google not only
knows my search history, but also about most of the other websites I visit. Well, this is not new.
But I personally find it wrong that if someone visits this blog, their information (ip address, user agent)
is not just transmitted to me, but also to third-party services which further share it with their
partners and advertisers.

So, I decided to correct it. I have now got StatCounter, Disqus and GoogleFonts API disabled for this blog.
Better late than *never*!
