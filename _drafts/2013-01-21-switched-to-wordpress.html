title: Switched to WordPress
summary: Finally I switched this blog from Blogger to a self hosted WordPress server. WordPress-Logo Enjoyed each of the many errors I got while transferring. I've tried my best editing permalinks, to redirect previous shared blogger links by adding .html at the end of the permalink. But if you still encounter errors, please mail me

<p>Finally I switched this blog from <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> to a self hosted <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> server.<img style="max-width:160px; float:right;" src="/files/wordpress-logo.png" alt="WordPress-Logo" /><br />
Enjoyed each of the many errors I got while transferring :D</p>
<p>I've tried my best editing permalinks, to redirect previous shared blogger links by adding <span style="font-family: monospace;">.html</span> at the end of the permalink. But if you still encounter errors, please mail me - <a href="mailto:me@jailuthra.in">me@jailuthra.in</a>.</p>
<p>I have hosted WordPress on my desktop for now, until I find a cheap and reliable hosting (and funds...), so the server maybe down during power failure, which in my city happens quite more often than expected.
Feel free to comment about this switch to WordPress</p>
