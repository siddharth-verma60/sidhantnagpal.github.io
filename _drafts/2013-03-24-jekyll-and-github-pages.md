This blog was on wordpress before, hosted on my desktop, I [posted about it](http://www.jailuthra.in/2013/01/switched-to-wordpress.html) earlier.
Hosting it on a daily-use desktop was quite heroic as well as <i>crazy</i> stuff to do. I had to frequently reboot my desktop, as I used it for many purposes other than as a server. And the blog was down for more than a week due to unavoidable circumstances.

But finally! The force showed me the path to [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com), where I learned about **Jekyll** which extends github pages to _not-just-html_.
I cloned [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), and installed the blog first locally then pushed the changes to my github repo [jailuthra.github.io](https://github.com/jailuthra/jailuthra.github.io). And now jailuthra.in points to <i>jailuthra.github.io</i>. No worries about uptime now! ;)
